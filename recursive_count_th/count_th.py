'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
    # TBC
    # base case -> reach end of string len(word) - 1
    # how many times does "th" occur within word
    # needs to call itself -> recursion
    # return the count of the occurences ** case matters **
    
    pass
